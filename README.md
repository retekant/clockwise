# Clockwise
---
An app used to track shifts while at work and at home. It shows the progress through a shift and the amount made during it, while also showing when lunch breaks start and end. Additionally, it saves the history of shifts locally, with it showing how much time you worked in total and how much you have made.

##### Storage
Everything will be saved locally to the browser, but if you need to transfer data there is also an import and export option in settings
